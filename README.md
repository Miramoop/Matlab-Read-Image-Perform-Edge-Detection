# Matlab-Read-Image-Perform-Edge-Detection
This project was developed during my Computer Vision course. First, we were given an example task to walk us through creating an image of a checkerboard and reading it into Matlab. Next, we explained how to make x and y gradients to perform edge detection, and we had to analyze our results and answer some questions. The second part was to complete the task of performing edge detection on an image provided and applying various thresholds to the edge detection function.
