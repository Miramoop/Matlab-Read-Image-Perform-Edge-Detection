# Matlab-Read-Image-Perform-Edge-Detection
This project was developed during my Computer Vision course. Our task was to be walked through Part A where we learned how to perform edge detection.  Then in Part B we used the knowledge gained to perform edge detection as  well as adding thresholds to this algorithm and displaying our results.
